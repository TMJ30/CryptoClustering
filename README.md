# CryptoClustering

A combination of Python and unsupervised machine learning was used to predict whether cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. We were tasked with analyzing the results and differences of the K-Means and Principal Component Analysis approach.



## **Findings**

After executing both approaches, K-Means and PCA resulted in the ideal number of clusters being 4. Upon further analysis of the individual cluster charts created for each approach, it is evident that PCA is a more suitable. The impact of using fewer features to cluster the data improves the clustering performance by producing clearer visualizations and more comprehensible. In addition, it also reduces the number of outliers and irrelevant data that could potentially confuse the clustering algorithm.
