# CryptoClustering

A combination of Python and unsupervised machine learning was used to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. Initially, we were tasked with finding the best value of k and producing the first cluster of cryptocurrencies with K-means using the scaled dataframe. Afterwards, we used the original scaled dataframe to optimize the clusters utilizing the Principal Component Analysis approach. The K-means and PCA approach reported the optimial number of clusters to utilize is 4. In comparing 




Scaled DataFrame...then Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA DataFrame What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
