# CryptoClustering

A combination of Python and unsupervised machine learning was used to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. We were tasked with two approaches to finding the best value of k, the K-Means and Principal Component Analysis. 

##Findings

After executing both approaches, K-Means and PCA resulted in the ideal number of cluster being 4. Upon further analysis between the individual cluster charts created for each approach, it is evident that PCA is a more suitable. The impact of using fewer features to cluster the data improves the clustering performance by producing clearer visualizations and more comprehensible. In addition, it also reduces the amount of outliers and irrelevant data tha could potential confuse the clustering algorithim.
