# CryptoClustering

A combination of Python and unsupervised machine learning was used to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. (First used Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Scaled DataFrame...then Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA DataFrame What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
